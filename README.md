# Road_accidents
The ANN establishes the general patterns of accidents on Jordan’s road network and provides an analysis of the contributory factors then describes the ANN system

# Input Variables :

## Number Of Population And Registered Vehicles 
It is generally the number of population and registered vehicles is conventional parameters in ANN model which used to predict the number of accidents in a developing country.

## Length Of Paved Roads
Increasing numbers of private cars, most streets are Damaged and Poor public transport network between cities are the main challenges facing the road networks and transport in Jordan, where is considered one of the most countries in the density of vehicles per km to 151Veh/km higher than the global average of 32Veh/Km only.
If we compare the increase in the length of the road network from 1990 to 2015 we will notice that the road network was 6040 km and 7299 km respectively , an increase of 1259 km in the last 25 years. On the other hand the increase reached in the number of vehicles in Jordan 1,167,200 vehicle in the same period. This shows the great pressure on the road network, especially in major cities, and this is reflected in the increase in the number of accidents in the last twenty-five years.

## GDP and GNI
Several economic studies have analyzed the relationship between economic factors and road traffic accident. Some researchers have concluded that national traffic accidents rates tend to increase in initial industrialization phases, but later decrease as the country’s economy expands.
These researches showed that while accidents have been increasing considerably for developing countries, they have been decreasing for high-income nations. They found that accidents rate is likely to increase as a developing nation’s income increases due to an increase in the number of automobiles on the road. As income continues to grow, however, the accidents rate begins to fall because governments invest in better road infrastructure and individuals invest in safer cars.
Here, there are two economic indicators : Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI) , in Jordan during last 25 years the GDP and GNI increase around 75%" Jordan considers ranked 123 as GDP in 2013".
GDP is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country, as well as a gauge of a country's standards of living. Since the mode of measuring GDP is uniform from country to country, GDP can be used to compare the productivity of various countries with a high degree of accuracy.
under Jordanian economic conditions we used another indicator reflecting the economic situation in Jordan ,Which depends on Remittances from expatriates, especially in the Arabian Gulf and foreign investments which is expressed in GNI.

## Numbers Of Temporary Arrivals
A large increase in the number of people who entered Jordan temporarily mainly expatriate Jordanians especially during summer from the Arab Gulf states for various reasons such as tourism and medical treatment. The strategic direction is to increase the number of visitors to Jordan in the coming years which constitutes a great challenge to the road and transport network as the Foreign vehicles participated in accidents were found to represent about 20% of the total accidents in 2015.

## Numbers Of Refugee
It is misleading to use the population in Jordan as input itself because the population has increased from 6 million to 9.5 million in less than four years because of the increasing number of refugees from neighboring countries. Certainly the numbers refugees impacted significantly on the number of accidents in Jordan.
